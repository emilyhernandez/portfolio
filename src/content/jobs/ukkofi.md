Joined as a junior developer in a two-person team to build a new invoicing and accounting platform for sole traders from greenfield to production. During my time at Ukko.fi, I authored the majority of the frontend code of the product. Later expanded into backend development, working on APIs and business logic in a mature production system.

Key contributions:
- Sole trader registration flow (account creation + business registration)
- Invoice and accounting entry creation
- Bookkeeping reports
- Tax return feature (frontend, calculation logic, Vero API integration, automated emails)

Also served ~1 year as Scrum Master before returning to a full-time engineering role.
