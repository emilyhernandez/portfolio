I started my career building user-facing applications, jumping into greenfield projects and learning by doing. Over the years, I've gradually taken on more responsibility beyond the UI — working on APIs, business logic, integrations, and production systems. I even did a brief stint as scrum master.

I’ve worked on features from early ideas all the way to production, and along the way I’ve learned as much from what didn’t work as from what did. It’s made me appreciate systems that stay understandable and manageable even as they evolve.

While frontend development is still a strong foundation for me, my current focus is deepening my backend expertise and understanding systems more holistically — from architecture decisions to deployment and operation.
