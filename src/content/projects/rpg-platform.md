For over a decade, I’ve been writing RPG stories with my friend. After struggling to organize characters, timelines, and lore across different tools, I started building a dedicated platform tailored to our needs as a passion project.

**Main takeaways:**
1. It’s worth getting comfortable with a tool in a simple context before using it in a larger project. Fastify’s plugin and lifecycle model took time to understand and distracted me from focusing on data modeling early on.
2. Designing the data model early helps clarify the overall architecture.
