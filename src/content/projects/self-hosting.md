Inspired by discussions around data ownership and EU-based alternatives to US services, I set up a home server using second-hand hardware as a personal playground for experimentation.

What started as Ubuntu Server on a Raspberry Pi eventually evolved into a dedicated SFF machine running Linux, after I ran into performance bottlenecks and learned the importance of validating the main use case first. I also experimented with Proxmox and GPU passthrough for a combined gaming/server setup — an idea that proved more complicated than practical.

This website is hosted on that home server.

**Main takeaway:** Test the main use case before committing to an architecture.
